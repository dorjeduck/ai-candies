This blog is driven by the idea to teach myself how to process and generate images with Tensorflow. The initial posts will mostly cover basic techniques which hopefully come in handy years later when I start trying to impress myself with more complex models based on these earlier insights. 

Please feel invited to come along with me on this journey. I will try to include links to the respective parts of the excellent [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/ "Tensorflow Homepage") documentation or other gems on the web as much as possible in order to make this whole endeavour at least of some benefit. 

As always, feedback and suggestions of any kind are highly appreciated.
