There are several impressive disadvantages to achieve this single purpose in the suggested way:1. complicated2. slow . memory inefficent | Enjoy . Getting ready . import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from matplotlib import pyplot as plt from IPython import display image_path = &#39;./imgs/fujiyama.jpg&#39; . Preprocessing image .

The early posts will mostly cover basic techniques which hopefully come in handy years later when I start trying to impress myself with more complex models based on these earlier insights. . Please feel invited to come along with me on this journey. I will try to include links to the respective parts of the excellent Tensorflow documentation or other gems on the web as much as possible in order to make this whole endeavour at least of some benefit. . As always, feedback and suggestions of any kind are highly appreciated. .",
